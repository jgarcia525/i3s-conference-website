				<p><strong>Ready to gain a competitive advantage?</strong></p>
				<p>Finding the most qualified person for any job can be tough and it becomes even more challenging if diverse job seekers
					don’t apply to companies because they don’t see others “like themselves.” Their resumes never even make it into the
					pile, making it impossible for companies to scout out and hire diverse talent.</p>
				<p>We’re here to help you find the best of the best! </p>
				<p>Acting as a conduit, the I3S Conference creates an open forum for job seekers and high caliber employers to connect
					and have real conversations about what employers are looking for and how job seekers can best prepare to apply. </p>
				<p><strong>Why is hiring for diversity so important?</strong></p>
				<p>
					<div><strong>Sometimes cutting edge just means doing what should have been done all along. </div></strong>Corporate
					leaders have an opportunity and a responsibility to do more than set up shop and run a company. They have the ability
					to mold and uplift diverse groups who have previously been overlooked. If we open our doors a little wider to be more
					inclusive, the positive impact is immeasurable.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Except we can measure the impact …</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div><strong>Businesses who are hiring for diversity are leading the way in more ways than one!</strong></div>Studies
					have shown that truly diverse companies produce <strong>19% more revenue.</strong> This may be because cognitively diverse
					teams solve problems faster and are <strong>12.9% more innovative</strong> than teams of more similar backgrounds. Hiring
					employees from diverse backgrounds also helps companies <strong>connect with a larger consumer base.</strong>
